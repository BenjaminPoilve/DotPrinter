As an assignment for our security class we had to investigate this [article](https://www.eff.org/fr/issues/printers)

Turned out this a quite common occurence. 
Three out of three printers were positive. Our school manuals had those points on them. 

The tested printers were two HP and one Ricoh. 

The program helps to detect the point using openCV (a quick hack, no good point for coding style!)
